# uzERP – Open Source Business Management

uzERP is an Open Source modular business system designed for UK Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SME). The system includes functionality that touches every business function as follows:

- Order-to-cash processing for both the sales and purchase processes including trade counter operations
- Manufacturing management including requirements planning and shop floor data collection
- Stock Management with multi location Warehousing
- Financial Ledgers – Sales, Purchase and General Ledger plus Cash Book
- Innovative drag and drop report writer
- Calendar including integration with Google Calendar

The Open Source nature of uzERP means that a business can implement modules that are applicable to their environment. Since the software itself is essentially free, organisations can implement uzERP in a phased way without the ‘big bang’ approach needed to get a quick payback from traditional upfront license fees.
